For this coursework, we were given a set of emails and were required to code a classifier in Python that determined whether an email was spam or 'ham' by calculating the likelihood that a set of spam words appears in each email. I was able to achieve an accuracy of 80% correctness using logarithms and conditional likelihoods.
